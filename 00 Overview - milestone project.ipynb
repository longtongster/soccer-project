    "- some sources use statistics of the game to predict the outcome of this game. **THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT.** Basicaly we want to predict the outcome of the coming match based on the data that is given before the match. This means you want to have a features that captures the teams form (e.g. have they been winning the last matches), do they play home or away what are the results of the last x matches between these teams.(see [how to predict soccer matches](https://spottis.com/sports/how-to-predict-football-matches-more-correctly/))\n",
    "- Given the above we really have some work in preparing the data. The idea is to create one row per match that includes the features above. Only once we have a sensible dataset we can start running simple regressions\n",
    "- start simple but maybe we can include player stats as. Theoretically you could usse the player stats against thresholds to determine a player stats (a bit like playstation fifa). \n",
    "- see advanced keras on datacamp chapter 2 to model team strength. \n",
    "    - The idea is to model team strengh through and embedding layer. subtract the output of the embedding layer of both teams and fit this to the score difference.\n",
    "    - the difference in goals can be used as an indicator for the team strengt (the stronger the team the more likey a larger difference)\n",
    "    - Note that using the same embedding layer to estimate team strenght will assume that team strength will not depend on wether the are home or away team (**assumption 1**)\n",
